# GNL

A small function that lets you read each line of a file.
Done as practice for 19 coding school.

Usage:

when you compile add "-D BUFFER_SIZE=X" to the compilation flags, where X is the buffer size.

example: 
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=32 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
```

or

Define BUFFER_SIZE in the .h
